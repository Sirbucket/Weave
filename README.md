# Weave
Minecraft modpack base for improving game performance, fixing bugs, and improving compatability for other mods or even controllers. May also create an optional branch that improves the look and feel of minecraft.

Based on fabric, uses mods located across CurseForge, Modrinth and Github to make minecraft better while maintaining vanilla pairity and mod support.
