# Weave
Minecraft modpack base for improving game performance, fixing bugs, improving compatability for other mods or even controllers, while simultaniously making the game look and feel better without losing the feel of vanilla.

Based on fabric, uses mods located across CurseForge, Modrinth and Github to make minecraft better while mostly maintaining vanilla pairity and mod support. The only thing that is changed is bug fixes/missing content (deepslate not working in the stonecutter etc).
