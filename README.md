# Weave
Minecraft modpack base for improving game performance, fixing bugs, improving compatability for other mods or even controllers, while simultaniously making the game look and feel better without losing the feel of vanilla.

Based on fabric, uses mods located across CurseForge, Modrinth and Github to make minecraft better while mostly maintaining vanilla pairity and mod support. The only thing that is changed is bug fixes/missing content (deepslate not working in the stonecutter etc or some GUI changes).

What is considered a bug or missing content? Things that are marked as such on mojangs bug tracker or are clearly not intended are considered bugs. Missing content is for content that should exist to maintain consistancy or because it exists (Like giants now having an AI from one of these mods or most potion effects now being brewable or just removing unnecessary RNG like horses getting worse stats when bred making it a waste of time or accuracy not being 1-1 with where you look, basically slight vanilla+).
